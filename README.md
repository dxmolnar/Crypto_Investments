This repo is about crypto currency data clustering

## The following steps were taken in this code:

-Import the Data 
-Prepare the Data
-Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data
-Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
-Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
-Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
-Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
-Visualize and Compare the Results

## The following libraries were used in this code:

-pandas
-hvplot
-pathlib
-sklearn

## Final Result

In my results the PCA optimized clusters show that the clusters become more distinct and well-defined, exhibiting clearer segmentation and separation.
